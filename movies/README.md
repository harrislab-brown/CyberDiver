# Movies

This directory contains supplementary movies of the CyberDiver.

## Movie S1

CyberDiver entering the water at 4 m/s while behaving as a 5 N/mm undamped linear spring. The impact is filmed from above the water surface with front lighting to visualize the CyberDiverâ€™s construction. The playback is 100 times slower than actual speed.

## Movie S2

Demonstration of CyberDiver actuation and its position control operating mode. As the CyberDiver hangs from a bungee, a demonstration of its position control operating mode is initiated by pressing the button on the control board. The nose then moves relative to the body in a sinusoidal profile, illustrating the functionality of the actuator.

## Movie S3

Visualization of the impulse response of the cyber-physical system. An impulsive load is applied to the nose of the CyberDiver while it is suspended from a bungee and the vibrational response filmed. In the left frame, the cyber-physical system operates as a nominally undamped linear spring with 5 N/mm stiffness. In the right frame, the cyber-physical system operates as a nominally undamped linear spring with 15 N/mm stiffness. A corresponding visual difference between the amplitudes and frequencies of the vibrational responses is apparent. The playback is 25 times slower than actual speed.

## Movie S4

The CyberDiver manipulates the crown splash by performing active maneuvers during impact. The CyberDiver enters the water at 2 m/s and initiates an active maneuver at the moment of impact. Five different maneuver cases are shown where the impactor either extends or retracts the nose, resulting in amplification or attenuation of the crown splash formation. Movie version of figures 6(A-E) in the article.

## Movie S5

Labeled version of the CyberDiver crown splash manipulation movie. Version of movie S4 with labels provided for the different maneuver cases and indications for the timing of the maneuver. The playback is 30 times slower than actual speed.
