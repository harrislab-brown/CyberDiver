This directory contains the KiCad design files, schematics, and Gerber files for the custom PCBs used in the CyberDiver. The control board and power board implment the majority of the functionality. The encoder daughterboard provides nose displacement measurements with an optical linear encoder (Celera CE300-40). The nose accelerometer board provides direct measurement of the impactor nose acceleration.
