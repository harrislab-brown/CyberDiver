This directory contains the mechanical design files for the CyberDiver including the native Autodesk Fusion 360 archive and step files. The disk flexures were laser-cut from blue-temper AISI 1075 spring steel sheet; everything else was machined from 6061 aluminum and clear anodized. The Python scripts can be executed with the Fusion 360 API to parametrically generate disk flexures with different cut profiles.
